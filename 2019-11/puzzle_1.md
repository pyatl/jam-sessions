# Novice Puzzle: Not Quite Lisp

From Advent of Code 2015, Day 1: <https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/1>

Write your code in `puzzle_1.py`. The functions `part_1` and `part_2` will automatically be provided with the puzzle input from `puzzle_1.txt`, as a string.

### Part 1

Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor `0`) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

An opening parenthesis, `(`, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, `)`, means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

For example:

- `(())` and `()()` both result in floor `0`.
- `(((` and `(()(()(` both result in floor `3`.
- `))(((((` also results in floor `3`.
- `())` and `))(` both result in floor `-1` (the first basement level).
- `)))` and `)())())` both result in floor `-3`.

To **what floor** do the instructions take Santa?

### Part 2

Now, given the same instructions, find the **position** of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor `-1`). The first character in the instructions has position `1`, the second character has position `2`, and so on.

For example:

- `)` causes him to enter the basement at character position `1`.
- `()())` causes him to enter the basement at character position `5`.

What is the **position** of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?
