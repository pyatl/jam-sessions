# Puzzle 1: Report Repair

From Advent of Code 2020, Day 1: <https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1>

## Part One

Before you leave \[for vacation], the Elves in accounting just need you to fix
your **expense report** (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite
adding up.

Specifically, they need you to **find the two entries that sum to `2020`** and
then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

    1721
    979
    366
    299
    675
    1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to `2020` are `1721` and `299`.
Multiplying them together produces `1721 * 299 = 514579`, so the correct answer
is `514579`.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. **Find the two entries that sum
to `2020`; what do you get if you multiply them together?**


## Part Two

[â€¦] Find **three** numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to `2020` are `979`,
`366`, and `675`. Multiplying them together produces the answer, `241861950`.

In your expense report, **what is the product of the three entries that sum
to `2020`?**
